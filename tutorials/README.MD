## Welcome to the tutorials!

### Notes:
1. Each of these Jupyter Notebook tutorials should be runnable within as long as the appropriate directories in the first few cells is updated according to your data and your machine.   

2.  If this repository was "cloned" using Github desktop, this folder will be included in versioning. Therefore, please copy and past the tutorial directory outside of the oct-cbort repository so that your edits will not be tracked by Git and will reduce confusing code changes.
