****These will not work until you edit them for your machine path/environment/processing pipeline ****

.Bat files are click - to - run files in Windows.

Using them makes processing a bit easier in some cases, ie. for batch processing or for popping up the simple gui

To edit them with the directory you'd like to process, right click and open with notepad.

In general, you can simply change the directory; but all of these bat files are edittable for any type of processing and only here to provide a template
